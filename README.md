Reasons
17.2: Apps that require users to share personal information, such as email address and date of birth, in order to function will be rejected

we found that your app requires customers to register with personal information such as a phone number to access non-account-based features, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.

Apps cannot require user registration prior to allowing access to app features and content that are not associated specifically to the user. User registration that requires the sharing of personal information must be optional or tied to account-specific functionality. Additionally, the requested information must be relevant to the features.
